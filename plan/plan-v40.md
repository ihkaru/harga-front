# Plan v40: Fix TypeError in AnalysisSection.vue

## Goal

The user is reporting a `TypeError: komoditasStore.fetchKomoditas is not a function` in `AnalysisSection.vue`. I need to fix this runtime error. I also need to be mindful of the user's manual changes and avoid regressions.

## Analysis

The error is caused by calling a function that does not exist on the `komoditasStore`. The function `fetchKomoditas` belongs to the `SyncService`. The code in `AnalysisSection.vue` should not be responsible for fetching the base commodity data; that is handled by `IndexPage.vue`. The `AnalysisSection` should only be responsible for fetching its own analysis data via `analysisStore.fetchAnalyses()`.

The user's manual changes are a concern. Since I completely overwrote the file, I have likely already erased their changes. This is a significant mistake on my part. I should have read the file first and tried to merge my changes instead of overwriting.

## Corrective Action Plan

1.  **Apologize and Acknowledge:** I must apologize for overwriting the user's manual changes. This was a major error. I will explain that I will fix the immediate bug and then we will need to address the lost changes.
2.  **Fix the TypeError:**
    *   Read the current (broken) `AnalysisSection.vue` that I just wrote.
    *   Identify the incorrect function call. It's likely in the `onMounted` hook.
    *   Remove the incorrect call to `komoditasStore.fetchKomoditas()`. The component should only call `analysisStore.fetchAnalyses()`.
    *   Implement the fix.
3.  **Address the Regression:**
    *   After fixing the bug, I will ask the user to provide the manual changes they made again.
    *   I will then create a new plan to carefully merge their changes into the new, working UI component. This is the only way to recover from my mistake of overwriting the file.
