# Plan v32: Update GEMINI.md with new planning instruction

## Goal

The user has requested that the new workflow instruction—to create a plan file in the `/plan` directory before every action—be permanently added to the `GEMINI.md` context file.

## Steps

1.  **Read `GEMINI.md`:** Get the current content of the `GEMINI.md` file to ensure I'm appending to it correctly.
2.  **Formulate the new section:** Create a new markdown section that clearly states the planning requirement. It should be phrased as a directive for me, the AI.
3.  **Append to `GEMINI.md`:** Use the `replace` tool to append the new section to the end of the `GEMINI.md` file. I will read the whole file and have the `old_string` be the original content and the `new_string` be the original content plus the new section.
4.  **Confirm with user:** Show the user the new content and confirm that it meets their request.
