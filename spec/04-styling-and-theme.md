# Styling and Theme

The application uses a combination of a dark theme for the hero section and a light theme for the main content area. This creates a visually appealing contrast and helps to focus the user's attention on the data.

**1. Color Palette:**

*   **Dark Theme (Hero Section)**: The hero section uses a dark background with a linear gradient from `#0a0426` to `#1a1040`. The text is white, and the accent color is a shade of purple (`#b19cd9`).
*   **Light Theme (Main Content)**: The main content area uses a white background with dark text. The accent colors are used for charts and other visual elements.

**2. Typography:**

The application uses a clean and modern sans-serif font. The font sizes are chosen to be readable and to create a clear visual hierarchy.

**3. Custom CSS:**

The application uses custom CSS to create unique styles and animations. The `glow-on-hover` class, for example, creates a glowing effect for the buttons in the hero section.

**4. Quasar Framework:**

The application is built with the Quasar Framework, which provides a set of pre-built UI components and a responsive grid system. This helps to ensure that the application is consistent and looks good on all devices.
